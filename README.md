# Typescript Package for [Saisonmanager.de](https://saisonmanager.de)

This package allows to get current match shedule, gaames, leagues, logos, match results, ...
that are all also shown in [saisonmanager.de](https://saisonmanager.de) via their API endpoints.

This allows to have the current games, placements etc in a clubs homepage to be presented automatically.

This is **_not an official package_** for Saisonmanager, I just created this library on my own instead of scraping Saisonmanagers website, I use their endpoints.

## Install

Via `npm`:

```
npm i git+https://github.com/nonsensation/floorball-saisonmanager.git
```
